BUILD THE PHASE 2.5 CUMULATIVE COVERAGE MATRIX, from the inventory rather than from memory.

The owner's directive requires a per-surface classification in FOUR states -- PREMIUM VERIFIED,
REDESIGNED AND VERIFIED, BLOCKED (with reason and remediation), OUT OF SCOPE -- maintained
cumulatively across waves, and says plainly: "A screen must not silently disappear from the
inventory" and "Do not claim 295/295 complete without evidence for every inventoried surface."

SO THE MATRIX IS GENERATED, NOT WRITTEN. It parses PHASE-2.5-SURFACE-INVENTORY.md and refuses to
emit anything if the row count moves without the expected total being updated to match. A
hand-maintained matrix is exactly how a screen disappears quietly.

A FIFTH STATE EXISTS AND IS DELIBERATE. `PENDING` is not one of the directive's four, because the
four describe a FINISHED surface. A cumulative matrix has to be able to say "not yet", and saying
it explicitly is the opposite of claiming completion. PENDING must be zero before Phase 2.5 can be
presented for acceptance; it is the number that makes that checkable.

VERIFIED MEANS RENDERED. A surface earns REDESIGNED AND VERIFIED only when the running application
was driven and captured in all four combinations (en-LTR and ar-RTL, light and dark). Inheriting a
shared component's repair is NOT verification -- the whole point of the Wave 1 table work is that
it reaches ~100 screens, and exactly three of them have actually been looked at.

        --check  exit 1 if the matrix on disk is stale, for CI. Writes nothing.
